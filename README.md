# EnergyPLAN Visualizer

An OpenSource sofware solution aimed to assisst the researchers in the energy field to visualize and analyze the output of EnergyPLAN.eu software.

Built with **Python3**, using **PyQt6**, **Panadas**, and **Plotly** libraries (thanks to all the devs)

Developed to run on Windows OS, since EnergyPLAN software is Windows only application, ~~willing to make a web app version of it in the future~~.
